# 🗺️ Regional Sales Analysis (Prem Co. | USA | 2014–2018) 

## 👩🏻‍💻📊 Project Overview – Sales EDA for Prem Co.

Over the course of this project, I explored five years of U.S. sales data (2014–2018) for Prem Co. to uncover deep business insights. My goal was to help stakeholders better understand seasonal trends, top-performing products, customer segments, and regional dynamics through an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) journey.

**🧹 Step 1: Profiling & Cleaning the Data**

* I began by examining the structure and consistency of the dataset.
* ✅ The schema was validated, missing budget values were filled where possible 🛠️, and data types were corrected 🧾 to ensure smooth analysis, especially for time-series operations.

**📈 Step 2: Understanding the Sales Landscape**

* Next, I dived into the metrics.

* 🔍 Revenue, profit margin, unit prices, and quantity sold were analyzed in detail.

* 🛍️ I identified top-selling products, most profitable channels, and regions driving sales. 

* 👤 Customers were segmented based on their behavior—high spenders, frequent buyers, and profit contributors stood out.

**📅 Step 3: Trends and Seasonality**

* With the cleaned data in hand, I charted the revenue trends over months and years.

* 📆 The visualizations revealed clear seasonal patterns, with noticeable dips during specific months.

* 🌀 One significant anomaly was a sales dip in 2017, which stood out and prompted deeper investigation.

**🚨 Step 4: Detecting Outliers**

* To maintain data integrity, I identified outlier transactions.

* 📊 Extremely high or low transaction values were flagged.

* 🧮 These anomalies were often tied to bulk orders or pricing errors that skewed overall performance metrics.

**🔗 Step 5: Correlations & Segmentation**

* Finally, I explored how key variables related to each other.

* 🔗 Revenue and quantity had strong correlations, while profit margins showed more variation.

* 🎯 I used bubble charts to segment customers by revenue, margin, and volume—giving a clearer picture of who matters most to the business.
